# Bot **performance**{: .color-primary}

This [**dashboard**](https://dashboard.llmtester.com/) helps HKTB internal users to track the performance of the chatbot. What this application demonstrates:

- ***Nested traces*** help to understand what is happening and identify the root cause of problems.

- ***LLM evaluation*** helps to detect hallucinations and measure performance across diverse tasks. 

- ***Prompt management*** is a systematic approach to storing, versioning and retrieving prompts in LLM applications.

- ***Quality*** is measured through user feedback, model-based scoring, human-in-the-loop scored samples or custom scores via SDKs/API (see scores). Quality is assessed over time as well as across prompt versions, LLMs and users.

- ***Cost and Latency*** are accurately measured and broken down by user, session, geography, feature, model and prompt version.

- ***Volume*** based on the ingested traces and tokens used.
